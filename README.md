# To play

A and D keys move the player avatar (the cat at the bottom) from side to side, A to the left and D to the right. 

The mouse is used to aim the Bubble shooter

The left mouse button or W are used to fire a bubble upwards towards the cluster of bubbles at the top of the screen.

Once a moving bubble hits the bubbles at the top, it joins the cluster. If it is in direct contact with a set of at least two other bubbles in direct contact with each other of the same color, then all of them are eliminated and the player gains points.

If bubbles are eliminated, there's a chance that a power-up will come falling from the sky. Maneuver the cat to catch it, and the score multiplier will change.

# Known bugs

The game functions almost perfectly. That said, slower computers that cause significant slow-down can mess with the collision detection, so some odd behaviour may result, but any crashes we could find because of this have been ironed out.
